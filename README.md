## Student life style

This project aims to predict students' GPA based on various daily habits and lifestyle factors. By analyzing data on study hours, extracurricular activities, sleep patterns, social interactions, physical activity, and stress levels, this model provides insights into how these factors correlate with academic performance.

Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to use data analysis and machine learning to predict the GPA of students based on their daily activities and stress levels. The project involves data exploration, visualization, and building a predictive model to forecast GPA outcomes.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

Study_Hours_Per_Day: Number of hours spent studying each day.
Extracurricular_Hours_Per_Day: Time spent on extracurricular activities each day.
Sleep_Hours_Per_Day: Number of hours of sleep per day.
Social_Hours_Per_Day: Hours spent on social activities each day.
Physical_Activity_Hours_Per_Day: Hours spent on physical activities each day.
Stress_Level: Reported stress level, likely on a scale (Low, Moderate, High).
The target variable for this project is the GPA.
